        <p>
          On the journey to fulfill requirements for my math minor, I've found
          myself having to choose between various classes that I can take, as
          I've completed every "required" course, and have reached the "just do
          some more math" stage of the minor. As such, I find myself taking
          learning group theory this semester. So far it's actually pretty
          interesting, as I enjoy writing proofs, and it beats doing matrix
          multiplication for 4 hours straight (my love/hate relationship with
          linear algebra can be discussed in the future). The main issue right
          now is really just that there's a lot of information to keep in your
          head at any given moment, so I'm hoping to make some posts on the
          topic every so often, as by writing it down I'm bound to remember it
          in the future. I'd also like to write down my own understandings of
          definitions and equations, as I feel like textbook descriptions can be
          quite confusing at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          This post is dedicated to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, specifically
          proving that it is valid. To do so, I should first explain a few
          definitions:
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, you have the notation for congruency under modulo. This is
          seen in the form of
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ y (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          This means that under modulo <span class="math-symbol">n</span> , the
          value <span class="math-symbol">x</span> is equal to
          <span class="math-symbol">y</span>. For instance, the following is
          true
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">5 ≡ 12 (mod 7)</p>
        <p>
          since <span class="math-symbol">12 - 7 = 5</span>. In general, I find
          it easier to work directly with the mathematical representation ,
          which can be done with the following statement
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ y (mod n) ↔ ∃k∈<b>ℤ</b>. x = y + nk</p>
        <p>
          This allows us to convert a congruency into a traditional math
          equation. This will be useful later on. Conceptually, it makes sense,
          as if
          <span class="math-symbol">x ≡ y (mod n)</span> then
          <span class="math-symbol">x - y</span> should be a multiple of
          <span class="math-symbol">n</span>, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          With those definitions, I can now introduce the version of CRM that I
          will prove. CRM states that if we assume the following two equations
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ a (mod m)</p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ b (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          Then if <span class="math-symbol">gcd(m, n) = 1</span>, there will be
          a unique solution for <span class="math-symbol">x</span> under
          <span class="math-symbol">(mod mn)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first saw this definition, it made sense to me on a high level,
          but I was unsure why
          <span class="math-symbol">gcd(m, n) = 1</span> was a needed
          requirement, and why the value for
          <span class="math-symbol">x</span> would be true under
          <span class="math-symbol">(mod mn)</span>. However, there is a
          straightforward way to prove this by simply following the math and
          using the prior statements to convert congruences. In fact, the first
          thing we can do is convert the congruences into equalities to get
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + mk for some k∈<b>ℤ</b></p>
        <p class="math-text">x = b + nd for some d∈<b>ℤ</b></p>
        <p>
          Next, we can substitute <span class="math-symbol">a + mk</span> into
          the second equation to get
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">a + mk = b + nd</p>
        <p>Rearranging the variables gives us</p>
        <p class="math-text">mk = (b - a) + nd</p>
        <p>We can then convert back into a congruence to give us</p>
        <p class="math-text">mk ≡ (b - a) (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          Before moving on, I must introduce another important idea, which is
          that the GCD of two numbers <span class="math-symbol">x</span> and
          <span class="math-symbol">y</span> can be expressed as a linear
          combination of the two, expressed as
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">
          ax + by = gcd(x, y) for some a∈<b>ℤ</b>, b∈<b>ℤ</b>
        </p>
        <p>Now, we can look at our current equation</p>
        <p class="math-text">mk ≡ (b - a) (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          The end goal is to solve for <span class="math-symbol">k</span>, such
          that we can plug the value in to solve for
          <span class="math-symbol">x</span> in the first equation. Therefore,
          we need to remove the <span class="math-symbol">m</span> in front of
          <span class="math-symbol">k</span> to reach our answer. Since we are
          working under <span class="math-symbol">(mod n)</span>, we could try
          to find a value <span class="math-symbol">c∈<b>ℤ</b></span> such that
          <span class="math-symbol">cm ≡ 1 (mod n)</span>, as that would leave
          us with only <span class="math-symbol">k</span>. But how do we know
          such a value exists? Well, we can convert the congruence into an
          equality to get
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">cm = 1 + nz for some z∈<b>ℤ</b></p>
        <p>Which we can rewrite as</p>
        <p class="math-text">cm - nz = 1</p>
        <p>
          This actually confirms that <span class="math-symbol">c</span> must
          exist, as the above claims that 1 can be expressed as a linear
          combination of <span class="math-symbol">m</span> and
          <span class="math-symbol">n</span>, which is true if
          <span class="math-symbol">gcd(m, n) = 1</span>. Looking back at the
          definition for CRM, we can now see why
          <span class="math-symbol">gcd(m, n)</span> was provided as a
          condition. Since we now know
          <span class="math-symbol">c</span> exists, we can multiply our
          congruence by it to get
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">cmk ≡ c(b - a) (mod n)</p>
        <p>Which reduces to</p>
        <p class="math-text">k ≡ c(b - a) (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          Huzzah! We now have a value we for <span class="math-symbol">k</span>.
          Before we plug it into our original equation, we should first convert
          it back into an equality, giving us
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">k = c(b - a) + nh for some h∈<b>ℤ</b></p>
        <p>Plugging this into our original equation gives us</p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + m[c(b - a) + nh]</p>
        <p>Which simplifies to</p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + mc(b - a) + (mn)h</p>
        <p>
          Importantly, this is now in a form that can be converted back into a
          congruence under <span class="math-symbol">mn</span>. We now have
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ a + mc(b - a) (mod mn)</p>
        <p>
          This confirms the fact that <span class="math-symbol">x</span> is a
          unique solution under <span class="math-symbol">(mod mn)</span> thus
          completing our proof (insert QED or □ or whatever it is we do these
          days).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, as a sanity check, we can confirm both congruences are true
          for this value of x.
        </p>
        <p>To do so, we look back at the original equality we found</p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + m[c(b - a) + nh]</p>
        <p>
          and notice that we can convert this into a congruence under
          <span class="math-symbol">(mod m)</span>, giving us
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ a (mod m)</p>
        <p>
          This matches the first congruence exactly, confirming it is valid! The
          second congruence is not as straightforward, but still pretty simple
          to confirm. We once again look back at the original equality we found
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + m[c(b - a) + nh]</p>
        <p>and distribute <span class="math-symbol">m</span> to get</p>
        <p class="math-text">x = a + mc(b - a) + n(mh)</p>
        <p>
          Similarly to before, we can notice that this can be converted into a
          congruence, this time under <span class="math-symbol">(mod n)</span>.
          This gives us
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ a + mc(b - a) (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          Now remember that <span class="math-symbol">cm ≡ 1 (mod n)</span>, so
          we can replace <span class="math-symbol">mc</span> with 1 in our
          congruence to get
        </p>
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ a + (b - a) (mod n)</p>
        which clearly simplifies to
        <p class="math-text">x ≡ b (mod n)</p>
        <p>
          This matches the second congruence exactly, meaning
          <span class="math-symbol">x ≡ a + mc(b - a) (mod mn)</span> satsifies
          both congruences. With that, CRM is officially proven!
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly like this form of the CRM proof as it leads you there
          by following a simple chain of math. It essentially just unfolds
          itself as you convert between equalities and congruences, and doesn't
          really require much in the way of external logic. In future posts, I
          hope to discuss more complicated proofs, as writing them out will
          likely help me remember them in more detail. Until then, I hope you
          found this proof mildly interesting, and if you didn't, thanks for
          reading through it at least!
