          I finally got around to making a website! Naturally the next thing to
          do is to add a blog section to the website, because who doesn't like
          talking about what's on your mind? And naturally the first thing on
          one's mind after making the website is the website itself, and thus
          the prophecy is fulfilled and the first blog post becomes a little
          meta.

          In all seriousness, I originally meant to set up a webpage when I
          first entered college in 2023. It seemed like a fun thing to do, and
          all the cool CS majors seemed to have sites of their own, and I didn't
          want to feel left out. However, it turns out that making a website is
          hard, or at least, not super easy. Hard is probably an overstatement,
          when the truth is more likely that getting started is hard. Once you
          crest that hill, the process actually gets oddly fun, though that is
          true for many projects, CS or not. All of that is to say that creating
          website was a very easy task to put off for me. I had class work to
          do, friends to make, and dining hall food to be sorely disappointed
          in. The thought of making a website would fade into the back of my
          mind, collecting dust alongside the myriad of other things in my
          "projects I want to eventually do but might just never do" pile.

          This would continue to be the way things were until Summer of 2025
          (almost 2 years later!), when I realized all those thoughts I had in
          freshman year. It was then I decided that it would be the Summer that
          I finally created my personal webpage, my small spot on the internet
          all to myself, my beacon of self-representation in the digital sea we
          all find ourselves in. This was it!

          Fall 2025 began, and I was officially a Junior at Northeastern. There
          was a stunning lack of a personal website, despite the supposed vigor
          in the paragraph above. In truth, I messed around with some files,
          maybe made a mock front page, got distracted, and proceeded to wallow
          away in the world of proof assistants and forget about it entirely. A
          shame really, but not exactly unexpected. It turns out life can be
          really busy sometimes, and also full of distractions. And so the
          desire to create a website would once again fade into the back of my
          mind, probably finding its place between "Make an in depth roguelike
          game sometime" and "Learn how to cook a good steak" (of which still
          remain unresolved aspirations).

          That brings me to Winter 2025, a few months after the events of the
          paragraph prior, and a few weeks before the time of writing this. The
          holiday spirit was setting in, and I was excited to spend a good week
          or two relaxing and maybe drinking some delicious eggnog (the hard
          part is gaslighting myself into believing it's not that unhealthy).
          Amongst all the joys of Christmas music and cheese platters from the
          relatives, a nagging thought returned to me. Perhaps Winter break
          would be when I finally made that website I wanted. It helped that I
          was finishing up a big project for Northeastern Electric Racing, and
          that was literally 3 months of web development. "If I could do that,
          surely I could make my own website too" I thought to myself. Plus I
          finally had free time to do what I wanted (I really enjoy research but
          it does keep you pretty busy). With that confidence in mind, I finally
          sat down and actually wrote down some code to lay the groundwork for
          the site. I wanted to do it the old fashion way, just to see what it
          was like, and to say that I had done it. That meant creating the
          HTML/CSS/Javascript file combination, which seemed intimidating to me
          at first. My prior comment becomes relevant now though, as it really
          was starting this project that was the hardest. Trying to make sense
          of how all the files interacted was a slight struggle at first, and
          getting CSS styles to work how I wanted in any way shape or form was
          frustrating to say the least. But once I had even a basic layout for
          how I wanted my site to look, it suddenly became so much easier, and
          to an extent, even enjoyable. Note that configuring CSS is not
          enjoyable, that still frustrates me to no end.

          We now come to the end of 2025, and the start of a brand new year. My
          efforts were paying off, and I actually had a decent looking (I hope,
          please don't judge too harshly) framework for a website that I was
          actually happy with. It wasn't perfect by any stretch of the
          imagination, but I've found that delaying in search of perfection just
          leads to a pile of abandoned projects. Importantly, it had the
          features I wanted. A front page, a space for projects, links to
          important websites, and contact information. It also had a space to
          write up blog posts, if I was ever inclined to put my thoughts down
          onto digital paper. The only issue was coming up with an initial topic
          to write about...
